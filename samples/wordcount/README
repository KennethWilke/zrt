Wordcount example for mapreduce library.
Every map node get source file as input via stdin.
Every reduce node get from every node mapped key/values, reduce it and output to stdout.
Both types of nodes logging into stderr.
For given job mapreduce library configured runtime to use key size=4byte and value size=4byte. 
But value can be set up to 128 then configuring mapreduce library;
User Map function: It's parsing every chunk of input data provided by MapReduce library as words delimeted by
space and '\0' null terminated chars and add to map(keys buffer, values buffer) as pair KEY_HASH=1;
