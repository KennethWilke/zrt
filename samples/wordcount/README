Wordcount example for mapreduce library.
Every map node gets source file as an input via stdin.
Every reduce node gets mapped key/values from map nodes, reduces it and outputs to stdout.
Both types of nodes are logging into stderr.
The mapreduce library is configured in runtime to use key size=4byte and value size=4byte. 
Value can be set up to 128 bytes then configuring mapreduce library.
User Map function parses every chunk of input data provided by MapReduce library as words delimeted by
space and '\0' (null terminated) characters and adds them to the map(keys buffer, values buffer) as a pair.
The result is a count for each hash key.
