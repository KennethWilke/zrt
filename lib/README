ZRT - ZeroVM runtime library
---------------------------------------------------------------
{DOCPATH}

1. ZRT is a part of libc, implementing syscalls and has own filesystem. Direct syscalls from user code to host system are not allowed, and such unsecure applications should not be validated by ZeroVM, see ZeroVM docs. 
2. Currently ZRT own 2 filesystems:
2.1  Rewritable filesystem, available in user space as mounted on "/" root. ZRT creates it at runtime in memory, and injects it by real directories/files if nvram feature used during startup before main() entry point.  All changes made in this filesystem will lost at nexe exit.
2.2  Channels mount filesystem - it is wrapper around zerovm channels, it's mounted into "/dev" folder. It has static structure based on channels aliases list, and interpret channels as devices. All channels aliases listed in zerovm manifest file should be started with /dev/ alias, that represents their belonging to /dev/ mount. Channels whose aliases not started with /dev/ will not be accessible by channels filesystem. Functions like stat, readdir are supported also;
2.2.1  Channels representation by stat function. Sequential access channels are represented as character devices; Random access channels are represented  as block devices;
2.2.2  Channels I/O. For channels described in manifest - input/output operations are available, and folowing allowed : 
Channel type SGetSPut=0, sequential  get / sequential_put
RDONLY     Seek pos —     get
WRONLY     Seek pos —     get
RDWR       Seek pos —     get
Channel type RGetSPut=1, Random get / sequential put
RDONLY     Seek pos — set get 
WRONLY     Seek pos —     get
RDWR       Write pos unavailable; Read Seek pos - set get;
Channel type SGetRPut=2, Sequential get / Random put
RDONLY     Seek pos —     get
WRONLY     Seek pos — set get
RDWR       Read pos unavailable; Write Seek pos - set get;
Channel type RGetRPut=3, Random get / Random put
RDONLY     Seek pos — set get
WRONLY     Seek pos —     get
RDWR       Seek pos — set get
2.2.3  Debugging channel. ZRT has its own debugging channel associated with alias name "/dev/debug". If this channel is defined then all debugging ZRT information will go into the debug channel If debug channel is not defined no debug info will available (apart from system logs). Debugging level are regulated by VERBOSITY environment variables and support 1,2,3 values.
