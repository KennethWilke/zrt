CPython for ZeroVM as part of ZRT library.
Porting based on sources of Python-3.2.2, and cross compiling using nacl-gcc;

Since all the code that must be run on Zerovm should be compiled statically, including CPython.
But CPython uses some technics of dynamic linking, it's used dlopen for example.
We are planning to replace all features uses dynamic linking to his static equialent; 
to get cpython statically compiled just redefine flags usable for dynamic linking to statically linked options

problems:
Some modules throw errors during compile by nacl-gcc.

howto:

1.copy this dir contents into python distr folder and run from cmdline to cross-compile cpython folowing executable scripts:
1build_pgen.sh
2build_cpython_statically_nacl.sh

2.Create TAR archive and add install python files copied from ~/Python-3.2.2/_install folder;

3.run python executable at samples/cpython and inject into ZRT-FS TAR archive contains python files;
