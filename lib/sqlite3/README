------------------------------------------------
1.Sqlite3 dbms static library. Ported to ZRT.
source: www.sqlite.org
------------------------------------------------

1.1.Since ZeroVM has no own filesystem, in any case we are need to provide access to database file;
For this case used virtual file system (VFS) API as part of sqlite, and our implementation that currently 
support read only database access without journaling;
Sqlite compiled with nacl-gcc doesn't support getpid and ftruncate, that will always fails;
1.2.In order to linking it add folowing flags: -L{YOUR_ZRT_ROOT}/lib -lsqlite3

TODO: Add ZFS to get sqlite working with real filesystem.
