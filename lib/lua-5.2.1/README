This is Lua 5.2.1, released on 08 Jun 2012.
Ported to ZRT.
Currently for I/O used only stdin & stdout by default opened files in LUA.
Current version of ZRT don't give networking for LUA, because only allowed 
pre-opened channels and user can't manualy open network channel as file. 
It will supported in LUA as soon as ZRT implements it;
