localization data contains two tar images, to get locale working with glibc both tar images should be mounted using /dev/fstab channel.

locale-lib.tar mount point /lib
locale-share.tar mount point /share

mount next files to get additional locales available:
locale-lib2.tar mount point /lib
locale-share2.tar mount point /share

For example of usage see samples/tarimage.
