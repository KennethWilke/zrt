PJD - Filesystem tests
--------------------------------------------
{DOCPATH}

Some changes was made in pjd-fstests engine to support zerovm
filesystem testing.  fstest every time invoked by prove just send
command line into background process fstest.nexe test via zerovm stdin
channel, result of every test are retrieved by fstest script and
returned into test suite.
every invocation of run_test.sh run all pointed tests in the same
background process, after completion of all tests background process
fstest.nexe is closing by kill_ftest.sh

Run all zrtfs tests:
    #./run_zrtfs_tests.sh
Run single test
    #./run_test "tests/mkdir/00.t"
Run whole tests directory
    #./run_test "tests/mkdir -r -v"    

That's all. Enjoy.

Currently supported operating systems: Linux.
Currently supported file system types: zrtfs.
