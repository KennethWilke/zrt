Libc test suite
--------------------------------------------
{DOCPATH}

Run glibc tests for zerovm using only one thing:
sh run_tests.sh

Some tests are using filesystem and to get it worked is used tarball
archive ./singles/archive/glibc-fs.tar added to manifest file of every
test, to be injected into nexes filesystem in memory; The main
interesting part of that archive are full list of localisation files
that used by glibc when nexe tries to setlocale;

Sections of tests which don't want be run:
./todo: 
Contains tests that require dependencies that should be ported;
./singles/xfail 
Contains all tests that fail at zerovm and at nacl glibc tests
./singles/xexcluded
Tests that was excluded in nacl glibc tests
