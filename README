ABOUT:
ZRT - ZeroVM Run-Time environment for user executables running on virtual hardware represented by ZeroVM.
ZRT acts as an operating system for user executable and is implemented as libzrt.a static library
NEXE is a user executable that was produced by nacl_gcc or nacl_g++ (part of Native Client SDK)

[lib] see /zrt/lib/README
It keeps library sources. Every C user application must include zrt.h to get working main() and 
must be linked with libzrt.a 
The main features are: Glibc support, SQLite3 library, Lua scripting language library
[samples] see /zrt/samples/README
It contains sample user code based on ZRT library.
[zvm] 
zerovm executable and also an API for ZRT library: zvm.h, zvm.o. In next releases zvm.o will replaced by libzvm.a 

HOW TO RUN:
In order to launch nexe on ZeroVM platform, we need to pass a manifest file as a paramenter.
